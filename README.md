👋 Hi, I’m Mihir Deshpande. Github Username: MihirD97

👀 I’m interested in making data simple for everybody!

🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision, Advanced Machine Learning, Optimization, Text Analytics, Marketing Analytics, Unsupervised Learning, Supply Chain Analytics, Time Series Analysis, Information Management and many other interesting subjects in my Masters course that give me an in depth understanding of data analysis and its role in decision making

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML and Data Science projects, help write articles that simplify data science concepts that seem daunting at first glance.
